# EV Adoption vs CO₂ Emissions: A Global Dashboard

*Testing whether EV adoption really delivers on its climate promise.*

---

## Executive Summary  

Billions are being invested globally in electric vehicles (EVs) to tackle climate change—but do they actually reduce emissions?  

This dashboard shows that **EV adoption alone does not guarantee lower CO₂ emissions**. Countries with clean electricity grids (e.g., Norway, Sweden) achieve significant reductions, while fossil-heavy grids (e.g., China, US, Australia) offset much of the benefit.  Even Brazil (low EV adoption) and France (nuclear-heavy) show that clean grids matter more.

**Key takeaway:** EVs deliver meaningful climate impact **only when paired with clean energy grids**.

## Problem Statement

Emissions from internal combustion engines (ICEs) are a major driver of climate change.

Transport accounts for roughly one-fifth of global CO₂ emissions, three-quarters of which comes from road transport.

This highlights the role of ICEs in global emissions. EVs are often promoted as a solution—but do higher EV adoption rates actually translate to lower per capita emissions?  

This project explores the relationship between **EV adoption, per capita emissions, and renewable energy** across 30 countries.

## Methodology

Data sources included:

- EV sales share by country (2013–2023)  
- CO₂ emissions per capita (2013–2023)  
- Population data (2023)  
- Share of electricity generated by renewables (2013–2023)  

![Datasets used chart showing 4 datasets combined for analysis](assets/datasets.png)

EV sales data covered 30 countries. The other datasets were cleaned and normalized to ensure **comparability across countries and years**.

### Decluttering Steps

To make the analysis clear:

- **Step 1:** Focused on **10 anchor countries**, with the remaining 20 shown as background context.  
- **Step 2:** Scatter plots were adjusted so anchor countries scale with **true population**, while the other 20 appear smaller. This preserves context but emphasizes the anchors.  

### Anchor Country Selection

Initially, I considered the **top 10 EV adopters**. Nine of these were European, creating a narrow perspective. To maintain **global balance**, I adjusted the selection:

- **European leaders:** Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, United Kingdom  
- **Major economies:** United States, China, Japan  
- **Global balance:** Brazil, Israel, Australia  

This mix avoids a Eurocentric bias while highlighting top EV adopters.  

### Renewable Energy Tiering

Countries were classified based on renewable energy share:

- **Tier 1 (70–100%)** – Clean grids  
- **Tier 2 (40–70%)** – Mixed grids  
- **Tier 3 (<40%)** – Fossil-heavy grids  

These thresholds are **intuitive cutoffs**, simplifying comparisons and reflecting common energy analysis practices.

## Results & Key Insights

### 1. EV Adoption Trends

*Key point:* EV adoption is accelerating globally.  

![EV adoption chart showing sales share growth 2013-2023 for 30 countries](assets/ev-adoption.png)  

Norway leads at **90% EV sales share in 2023**.  

---

### 2. CO₂ Emissions Trends  

*Key point:* Emissions are falling unevenly.  

![CO₂ emissions per capita chart 2013-2023 for 30 countries](assets/co2-emissions.png)  

Sweden has one of the lowest per capita emissions at **3.46 t/person in 2023**.  

---

### 3. EV Adoption vs CO₂ (Initial Scatter)  

*Key point:* The relationship between EV adoption and CO₂ emissions is unclear.  

![Scatter plot showing EV adoption vs CO₂ per capita for 30 countries, anchors highlighted](assets/ev-vs-co2.png)  

- Low EV/high emissions: Australia, United States  
- High EV/low emissions: Norway, Sweden  
- Low EV/low emissions: cluster of other countries  
- High EV/high emissions: Iceland  

China appears in the middle of the chart: it has high EV adoption but also very high total CO₂ emissions. Even with its large population, its per capita emissions remain high.

The scatter shows **EV adoption alone does not explain CO₂ outcomes**. The missing factor is likely **the energy grid**.  

---

### 4. Renewables vs CO₂

*Key point:* Renewable energy reveals patterns.  

![Scatter plot of renewable energy share vs CO₂ per capita showing trend of lower emissions with higher renewables](assets/renewable-vs-co2.png)  

Countries with higher renewable energy share generally have lower per capita CO₂.  

---

### 5. Renewable Energy Tiers

*Key point:* Countries fall into three clean energy tiers.  

![Bar chart showing countries grouped into Tier 1, 2, and 3 based on renewable share](assets/country-tiers.png)  

Tiering provides a simple way to **compare EV adoption vs emissions across grids**.  

---

### 6. EV Adoption vs CO₂ (Tiered Scatter)  

*Key point:* Tiered analysis clarifies the relationship.  

![Tiered scatter plot showing EV adoption vs CO₂ per capita, color-coded by renewable energy tier](assets/tiered-ev-vs-co2.png)  

- **Tier 1 (green):** High EV adoption → low emissions  
- **Tier 2 (yellow):** Mixed outcomes  
- **Tier 3 (red):** High emissions despite EV adoption  

**Conclusion:** EV adoption **only works when paired with clean grids**.

## 5. Notable Cases

From visual inspection: red (Tier 3) countries cluster in the upper left (low EV adoption, high emissions), green (Tier 1) in the lower right (high renewables, low emissions), while yellow (Tier 2) are scattered across the chart.  A few countries stand out in ways worth highlighting, either because of unique energy choices or population effects.  

- **Iceland:** Nearly 100% of Iceland's electricity comes from renewable sources, yet its per capita CO₂ emissions are very high. This is because the country has a small population and energy-intensive industries, such as aluminum smelting, which inflate per-person figures [3].  

- **India:** India has the third-largest total CO₂ emissions in the world, but its per capita emissions remain low due to its huge population, which “dilutes” per-person emissions [4].  

- **Mexico:** Mexico’s per capita CO₂ emissions are moderate, despite being the 13th largest total emitter globally. Its large population reduces per-person emissions, and the country is beginning to adopt more renewable energy [5, 6].  

- **Brazil:** Brazil benefits from a renewable-heavy electricity grid (~89% from hydro, biomass, wind, and solar), but its EV adoption is low. As a result, it has relatively low per capita emissions despite limited EV penetration [7].  

- **France:** France’s per capita CO₂ emissions are low despite being in a fossil-heavy Tier 3 grid. About 70% of its electricity comes from nuclear power, which does not produce CO₂ [8].  

- **Sweden:** Sweden has 69.48% renewable electricity, just below the Tier 1 cutoff, yet its per capita emissions are very low. While technically Tier 2, it behaves like Tier 1 due to high clean energy usage.

## Conclusion  

EV adoption is **not a silver bullet**. The **cleanliness of the electricity grid** determines real impact:

- Norway & Sweden: Renewables + EVs → strong reductions  
- France: Nuclear → low emissions  
- Brazil: Renewable-heavy grid → low emissions despite limited EV adoption  
- China & US: Fossil-heavy grids → EV adoption offset  

**Lesson:** EVs deliver climate benefits **only with low-carbon energy**—renewables, nuclear, or other clean technologies.  

---

## Next Steps  

Future analysis could break down **renewables by type** (solar, wind, hydro, etc.) to identify which sources maximize emission reductions. This could guide **country-specific policy and investment decisions**.
